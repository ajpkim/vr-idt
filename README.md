# vr-idt

This package provides a VR tailored eye-tracking classification algorithm for identifying fixations and saccades in data gathered from VR headsets.

## Background

The algorithm was initially proposed and implemented by Jose Llanes-Jurado, Javier Marín-Morales, Jaime Guixeres, and Mariano Alcañiz in their paper, [Development and Calibration of an Eye-Tracking Fixation Identification Algorithm for Immersive Virtual Reality](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/17/4956).

Code from the original authors is here [github/ASAPLableni](https://github.com/ASAPLableni/VR-centred_I-DT_algorithm).

## Installation

Install this package using `pip` ([Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

`$ pip install vr-idt`
